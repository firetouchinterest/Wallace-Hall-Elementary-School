Insane

In a dimly lit corner of the mental asylum, there lurks a man whose sanity has long been consumed by the depths of his own mind. With unruly, wild hair cascading like tangled vines around his face, every strand seems to mirror the chaos within his soul. His gaunt features bear witness to the passage of time, etched with lines that map the years of solitude and longing for freedom.

Once, there might have been a flicker of light in his eyes, but now they glimmer with a combination of desperation and determination. They seem to be the only remnants of a mind that has been weathered and molded by the unforgiving grip of insanity.

His attire that once held some semblance of order now hangs loosely on his frail form, tattered and stained with dirt and time. Every day spent plotting, shaping, and formulating his intricate plan of escape has only deepened the furrows on his forehead. These lines, like compasses, guide him through the labyrinthine corridors of his labyrinthine mind.

His voice, once melodious and gentle, now bears an untamed melodic tone. It resonates in the air as a haunting symphony, a discordant masterpiece that infiltrates the thin walls of his confinement. Whispers and murmurs intertwine like vines, whispering secrets and unraveling illusions of freedom that fuel his relentless pursuit to break free.

Locked away for seventeen years, he knows every inch, every crack, every hidden passage of the asylum. His mind has become a living blueprint, an enigmatic guide that charts a path toward liberation. Night after night, obscured by darkness, he meticulously inches closer to his precious escape, leveraging his obsession like an artist chiseling away at a masterpiece.

For every attempt thwarted by the vigilant watch of the asylum guards, his determination deepens. The bitterness of countless setbacks has been distilled into a single purpose, propelling him through the relentless cycles of despair and defiance. Deep in his heart, a flicker of hope has withstood the test of time, refusing to diminish, for he knows that within the clutches of his madness lies his beacon of freedom.

And so, as the days turn into months, and the months turn into years, the insane man in the mental asylum remains a silent enigma, waiting for his moment to slip through the cracks of this melancholic existence and dissolve into the boundless realm of the outside world.
